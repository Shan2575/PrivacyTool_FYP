# Privacy Health Monitoring Tool
#### Investigating Web Tracking Technologies and Techniques to Measure Online Privacy. <br> Final Year Project by Brian Shanahan - University of Limerick (21/22)
#
For my final year project, I investigated various web tracking technologies that are used to track individuals across the web. I researched a few techniques to measure privacy health and mitigate the more pervasive of these tracking technologies. I also developed a simple privacy tool as part of my FYP, allowing users to view and manage some trackers on their system.

It is set to look for HTTP Cookie trackers within the Chrome browser and allows you to delete select (or all) trackers from the system. It also lets you monitor incoming trackers as you browse online and a blacklist functionality. Below are some screenshots of the privacy tool in action. For more detail on the investigation, see the report above.
